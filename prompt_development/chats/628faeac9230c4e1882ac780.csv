ego,I have to say that I think both are equally hypocritical - it seems like a necessary trait to be a politician.
alter,"I think Democrats can be hypocritical, but Republicans are more so. They say they want to protect children's lives but do nothing to do so."
ego,I agree on that. I also see D's being hypocritical about the issue of banning lawmakers from trading stock.
ego,"""Ethics for thee but not for me"""
alter,"Yes, I can definitely see that too"
ego,I think that as long as lawmakers have to rely on funding from companies they will always be hypocrtical.
ego,(sorry for spelling)
ego,I think both sides are also really hypocritical when they compare abortion rights to death penalty.
alter,Agreed. I also really dislike how Republicans (in my experience) are much less likely to take into consideration new evidence that goes against their beliefs. I think Democrats are less likely to do that.
ego,Two very different situations.
ego,"I agree - it's just ""fake news"""
ego,What do you think if the most hypercritical thing related to the recent shootings?
alter,"I think it's incredibly hypocritical for Republicans to say they want to end the shootings, but they refuse to actually put into effect things that are proven to work in other countries because it goes against their 'freedoms'. "
alter,I would gladly sacrifice some of my 'freedoms' if it meant saving innocent lives.
ego,Do you think it's because of the influence ($$$) the NRA has over them?
alter,"To an extent. They do depend on the money. But I think it also boils down to their priorities and morals, which I think are misaligned with what the rest of the country wants."
ego,"I also think a big contradition with the Rs recently is how they want to punish business when the business speaks out against them, but that had a fit a few years ago when D's wanted to boycott Goya."
alter,"I don't know enough about that to have an opinion on it, honestly. That's something I'll look more into."
ego,Seems like there are plenty of things to point to!
alter,Could you tell me more about it?
ego,"Florida punishing Disney because Disney criticized the ""Don't say gay bill"""
alter,"Oh, I see what you mean now. Yes, that is hypocritical. They punish Disney, but I remember when that bakery refused to make a cake for someone of a certain demographic and the Rs backed them up. "
