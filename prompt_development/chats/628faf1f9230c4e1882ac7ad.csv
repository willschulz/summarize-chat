ego,Both groups. No one will work with the other group to resolve issues.
ego,"Both groups find fault with each other but will not work to resolve issues. each plays the ""blame game"""
alter,"In my experience, current Republican reasoning leaves much to be desired. One example is how they are treating the right to abortion. They say they value human life yet they just voted against a bill to help acquire more formula for babies alive today facing a formula shortage. Pretty hard to ignore their decisions going against their purported ideals "
ego,yes. Their not working the situations out.
ego,Why choose pro life and then not let babys be fed.
alter,Another observation is how Republicans are actively voting against any bills that would restrict or add more qualifications to possessing a firearm in America. I can't understand how a party of people claim to value human life yet haven't proposed anything as far as gun control laws go
ego,I see this with Democrats (Biden) stopping gas production and then releasing gas from the reserves. Doesn't make any sense at all.
alter,My issue with Democrats is that they are not fighting with the same tenacity Republicans are to correct the misinformation/hypocrisy with which Republicans seem to be making their decisions today. I feel like having more people in government with educator backgrounds may be more useful towards explaining the consequences of these decisions to the public that may be uninformed or undecided
ego,I see misinformation from both groups being presented daily. 
ego,I don't know who or what information to trust anymore.
