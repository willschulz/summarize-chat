ego,Hello!
alter,hello
alter,Would you like to start
ego,I think that Republicans are far more hypocritical
ego,They say that they want freedom and then restrict abortion rights
ego,They complain about the education system but don't want to fund it
ego,What do you think?
alter,I agree with you and I'm struggling to think of an area Democrats are hypocritical in
ego,Some democrats are hypocritical like Joe Manchin
alter,He's more of a liar than a hypocrite
alter,"I suppose he's hypocritical in that he complained that the Senate doesn't do anything, but he refuses to do anything himself even when he's the only one needed to get things done"
ego,right? I think Biden has been pretty good about keeping his promises. Better than Obama. Obama made several promises that he didn't carry out.
alter,"But as a whole the Democrats don't seem hypocritical to me, just ineffective"
ego,The Republicans were also hypocritical when it comes to Supreme Court nominations
alter,Yes
ego,chastising Democrats and then doing exactly what they said Democrats should not do
alter,Their reason for not seating a Justice during Obama's last term was immediately tossed aside to get an unqualified Barrett on the court
ego,yep!
alter,I think their biggest hypocrisy is their moral outrage
ego,at least Obama's choice is effective in the Justice Department
alter,"If there's a school shooting like, I don't know, the one we just had"
alter,They act outraged if anyone brings up guns
alter,Don't disrespect the memory of the children by mentioning guns
ego,we've had several mass shootings over the last year and Republicans act outraged but seem like they want to  hand a gun to every American
ego,I think all politicians are hypocritical when it comes to campaign donations and stock market investments.
alter,And they don't want to talk politics but that's all their abortion stance is
alter,Yes
ego,"Republicans are super hypocritical in talking about how social security is lacking but then they raid ""surpluses"" from it..."
alter,"At least they've stopped trying to repeal healthcare, for now"
ego,they want freedom to make their own decisions about their life and mask wearing but then they won't give me freedom on whether I want to have a child or not
alter,Oh the coronavirus debacle. I wasnt even thinking about that
ego,I think the majority of the Republican platform is hypocritical
ego,they just want whatever puts money in their pockets 
alter,Yes
