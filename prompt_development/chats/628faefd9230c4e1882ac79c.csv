ego,Hi
alter,"Hello, how are you?"
ego,What is your opinion on the school shooting in Texas
ego,am doing very well
alter,I feel that republicans are more hypocritical because they make it very hard to work with democrats.  What are your thoughts?
alter,"Btw I was deeply saddened, hurt and upset by the Texas school shooting."
ego,Ooooh yes the conservative nature of the republicans is just absurd. Hard to reason together and come up to a mutual agreement.
alter,"Republicans tend to oppose many important things such as gun control, recreational drug use and affirmative action. "
ego,"For instance on taxes, it only makes sense that taxation is progressive. How do they propose taxes to be the same regardless of the pay grade. Not making sense at all"
alter,"You are absolutely right, it makes no sense whatsoever!"
ego,Generally I do not like their way of reasoning. 
alter,They make it so hard for us to come together as one nation to make this country a better place.
ego,I agree
