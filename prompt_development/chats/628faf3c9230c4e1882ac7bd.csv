ego,"I feel that Republicans are more hypocritical.  They claim to be pro-life - as in they're anti-abortion, but they are not pro-life if they are against universal healthcare and pro-guns."
alter,"Hello! I feel as though republicans are more hypocritical. They preach about family values while doing everything they can not to support families. They preach about being ""pro life,"" yet stop caring about anyone's life once they are born, they don't support healthcare or welfare benefits at all, they do nothing for mental health or any other type of social support. They are absolutely in no way ""pro-life"" or even centered around family values."
alter,"I completely agree about them being pro-guns! Even though 90% of the population is in support of universal background checks, the republican leaders consistently vote against every single bill that involves any sort of gun control."
ego,"They also claim to be against big government, but they are hypocritical in this regard. They want a big powerful leader to watch over us.  They gave Trump a ton of executive power when he was in office.  They also want big government telling us what we can do with our bodies.  They want big governments to tell us what sexual orientation to be.  They want big governments telling us whether or not we are allowed to do things like medical marijuana."
ego,"You mention they are against welfare, but they have no problem giving handouts to big corporations.  They are very hypocritical."
alter,"Absolutely. I agree--they are all for giving one or two people enough power to control the entire government and country as a whole, yet preach about big government. To them, ""big government"" only applies to social agencies, apparently."
ego,It truly is a shame.
alter,"I completely agree about corporate handouts. They will support tax breaks and handouts for anyone who contributes 6+ figures to them, personally, but they don't support any sort of tax break or social support system for their own constituents."
alter,The saddest part is that their constituents continue to support them. They believe the politicians' rhetoric and actively vote against their own best interests.
ego,Unfortunately many Americans cannot see this.  And they will continue to vote the hypocrites into offices.  The voters themselves are often just as hypocritical as the ones they elect
ego,"They want the poor to pull themselves up by their boot straps, but they don't give them the boots to begin with.  People need support and help every now and then.  When you work paycheck to paycheck with a family it's hard to contribute or better yourself."
