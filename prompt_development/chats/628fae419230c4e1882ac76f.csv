ego,Hi there
alter,Hi! How are you?
ego,Good! how are you today?
alter,"I'm good! Regarding the discussion, I definitely think Republicans are more hypocritical than Democrats. "
ego,I'm probably being biased but I think given recent events in Texas Republicans are more hypocritical...
alter,For sure
ego,"Some examples the shooting at the elementary school Republicans argue we need "" a good guy with a gun"""
alter,Think about their stance on gun rights versus their stance on abortion. 
ego,right that's a good example
alter,Everyone is entitled to an AR-15 but women aren't entitled to choose about their own bodies
ego,or the fact that theres also no child support for the families once a child is born
alter,They care about unborn babies but not children who want to be safe at school
ego,"there's news reports now that there were plenty of officers that had guns, and refused to go into the school to get the shooter"
alter,"Oh, then the argument about guns saving kids in schools is wrong"
ego,right and they continue this argument..
alter,It's all about money in the end
ego,yup yup
ego,I think they are also hypocritical about giving tax breaks
alter,As long as they are being funded they will continue to support full gun rights
alter,They are hypocritical about pretty much everything if it suits the narrative
ego,yes anyting to stay in power. it's really bad...
ego,yes. tax breaks are only for companies and the wealthy
ego,they will lose their minds if an average American gets even a small return
alter,And health care is only for those who can afford it
ego,"right. i have no idea what they are talking about when they say ""healthcare should be a choice"" HAHA"
alter,Whereas the people who really need help are ignored
ego,yes
ego,healthcare already isn't a choice. most people can only afford what their employer offers
ego,or straight up not afford anything at all
alter,The thing that worries me is they will say that Trump doesn't represent the Republican party but they will fight to get him elected again
ego,yes bc his supports allow them to win
ego,and be in power
alter,It's terrifying to think that he could be President again
alter,Because he's the biggest hypocrite of them all
ego,I like how they also say they want to keep jobs for Americans. but don't do anything about companies that literally offshore thousands of jobs
ego,oh yeah he's such a great liar. and they'll make up excuse after excuse for him
alter,"Yes, because those companies are giving them huge amounts of money in political donations"
ego,"""he doesn't pay taxes bc he's a great businessman"" ðŸ™„"
alter,At the end of the day it all comes down to money
ego,yeah its quite disgusting we have let companies run America not the ppl
