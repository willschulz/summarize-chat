Person A: Hello!
Person B: hello
Person B: Would you like to start
Person A: I think that Republicans are far more hypocritical
Person A: They say that they want freedom and then restrict abortion rights
Person A: They complain about the education system but don't want to fund it
Person A: What do you think?
Person B: I agree with you and I'm struggling to think of an area Democrats are hypocritical in
Person A: Some democrats are hypocritical like Joe Manchin
Person B: He's more of a liar than a hypocrite
Person B: I suppose he's hypocritical in that he complained that the Senate doesn't do anything, but he refuses to do anything himself even when he's the only one needed to get things done
Person A: right? I think Biden has been pretty good about keeping his promises. Better than Obama. Obama made several promises that he didn't carry out.
Person B: But as a whole the Democrats don't seem hypocritical to me, just ineffective
Person A: The Republicans were also hypocritical when it comes to Supreme Court nominations
Person B: Yes
Person A: chastising Democrats and then doing exactly what they said Democrats should not do
Person B: Their reason for not seating a Justice during Obama's last term was immediately tossed aside to get an unqualified Barrett on the court
Person A: yep!
Person B: I think their biggest hypocrisy is their moral outrage
Person A: at least Obama's choice is effective in the Justice Department
Person B: If there's a school shooting like, I don't know, the one we just had
Person B: They act outraged if anyone brings up guns
Person B: Don't disrespect the memory of the children by mentioning guns
Person A: we've had several mass shootings over the last year and Republicans act outraged but seem like they want to  hand a gun to every American
Person A: I think all politicians are hypocritical when it comes to campaign donations and stock market investments.
Person B: And they don't want to talk politics but that's all their abortion stance is
Person B: Yes
Person A: Republicans are super hypocritical in talking about how social security is lacking but then they raid "surpluses" from it...
Person B: At least they've stopped trying to repeal healthcare, for now
Person A: they want freedom to make their own decisions about their life and mask wearing but then they won't give me freedom on whether I want to have a child or not
Person B: Oh the coronavirus debacle. I wasnt even thinking about that
Person A: I think the majority of the Republican platform is hypocritical
Person A: they just want whatever puts money in their pockets 
Person B: Yes
