Person A: Republicans 
Person B: Hello! I would agree with that
Person A: Yessir, why would you say? 
Person B: They seem to always push things for "family values" regardless of how it affects real american families accross the nation
Person A: I agree 100%.
Person B: Is there anything specific you would like to add?
Person B: I also feel like their hypocrisy towards the COVID 19 vaccines saying they should be able to do what they would like with their bodies is pretty hypocritical in conjunction with their views on abortions
Person A: It’s just that, and they don’t really care about as much as they try to make it seem. Like the abortions, nobody should have the right to tell someone what they can and can’t do wit their bodies so i would have to agree on that too!
