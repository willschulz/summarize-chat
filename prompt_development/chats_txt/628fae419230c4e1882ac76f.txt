Person A: Hi there
Person B: Hi! How are you?
Person A: Good! how are you today?
Person B: I'm good! Regarding the discussion, I definitely think Republicans are more hypocritical than Democrats. 
Person A: I'm probably being biased but I think given recent events in Texas Republicans are more hypocritical...
Person B: For sure
Person A: Some examples the shooting at the elementary school Republicans argue we need " a good guy with a gun"
Person B: Think about their stance on gun rights versus their stance on abortion. 
Person A: right that's a good example
Person B: Everyone is entitled to an AR-15 but women aren't entitled to choose about their own bodies
Person A: or the fact that theres also no child support for the families once a child is born
Person B: They care about unborn babies but not children who want to be safe at school
Person A: there's news reports now that there were plenty of officers that had guns, and refused to go into the school to get the shooter
Person B: Oh, then the argument about guns saving kids in schools is wrong
Person A: right and they continue this argument..
Person B: It's all about money in the end
Person A: yup yup
Person A: I think they are also hypocritical about giving tax breaks
Person B: As long as they are being funded they will continue to support full gun rights
Person B: They are hypocritical about pretty much everything if it suits the narrative
Person A: yes anyting to stay in power. it's really bad...
Person A: yes. tax breaks are only for companies and the wealthy
Person A: they will lose their minds if an average American gets even a small return
Person B: And health care is only for those who can afford it
Person A: right. i have no idea what they are talking about when they say "healthcare should be a choice" HAHA
Person B: Whereas the people who really need help are ignored
Person A: yes
Person A: healthcare already isn't a choice. most people can only afford what their employer offers
Person A: or straight up not afford anything at all
Person B: The thing that worries me is they will say that Trump doesn't represent the Republican party but they will fight to get him elected again
Person A: yes bc his supports allow them to win
Person A: and be in power
Person B: It's terrifying to think that he could be President again
Person B: Because he's the biggest hypocrite of them all
Person A: I like how they also say they want to keep jobs for Americans. but don't do anything about companies that literally offshore thousands of jobs
Person A: oh yeah he's such a great liar. and they'll make up excuse after excuse for him
Person B: Yes, because those companies are giving them huge amounts of money in political donations
Person A: "he doesn't pay taxes bc he's a great businessman" ðŸ™„
Person B: At the end of the day it all comes down to money
Person A: yeah its quite disgusting we have let companies run America not the ppl
