Person A: Hello
Person B: Hello there
Person B: How are you doing
Person A: Good
Person B: I think that both Republicans and Democrats are hypocritical to some extent. Just because we identify as Democrats doesn't mean we see the party as immune to any criticism
Person A: i feel that Democrats are more Hypocritical because they want to change the way of things and make radical changes that a lot of people are not ready for.
Person B: That may be true, but is that what it means to be hypocritical?
Person A: Republicans have a tendency to just say "So what". Or point to things that are established like the consitution.
Person B: If I was thinking of hypocritical actions in a political way, it'd be like a candidate saying something to get elected, winning the election, and doing something else entirely
Person B: Or promising something and not following through with it
Person B: which is extremely common
Person A: Hypocrisy as you said can be both ways in politics especially. Many promise things and then realize that either they cant do things because of obstacles and then have to comprimise or not do what they promised
Person B: Republicans "over-relying" on the Constitution or dodging questions doesn't make them any more or less hypocritical than Dems... it would have to be context dependent at the very least
Person B: Yeah, exactly
Person B: It's hard to quantify which party is more hypocritical
Person B: You'd have to define a metric by which you're measuring hypocritical-ness
Person B: And even then, it'd be hard. Would you count the number of candidate that either didn't deliver or did something else from what they've promised?
Person A: I think those who just go with the party majority are hypocritical in a sense. They seem to catch themselves by saying one thing but if a leader in their party says something else they blindly agree
Person B: That's a good point too
Person B: A lot of people identify with something so strongly, they don't realize when it's not in their actual interests anymore
Person A: I think a lot of polittains nowadays know that there are polarising virepoints and a real lack of comprimise so they cater to that in order to stay relavant for the next elections.
Person B: Not to like dictate what peoples' interests are or aren't, but a lot of Republicans and Democrats go along with candidates' positions even if it's against what they personally think
Person B: Unfortunately I agree. It's all a disparaging act
Person A: A lot of pollitics is very surface level and entertainment almost. Like WWE. People are entertained by conflict and absurdity
Person B: Hopefully everyone can be more autonomous with their thoughts and politics can start being discussed openly and honestly
Person B: It's awful that it's almost a "taboo" topic in the USA because people aren't willing to hear other sides or compromise
Person B: A lot of that lack of compromise leads into the hypocrisy you talked about
Person B: It leads to lack of self awareness
