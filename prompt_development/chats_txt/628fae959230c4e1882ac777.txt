Person A: I think republicans are more hypocritical. They suggest ways of doing things and things that are wrong but they still do them.
Person B: I think Republicans are far more hypocritical.  They constantly change their policy and are moving goal posts non stop.  Body choice and abortion come to mind. 
Person B: I agree. During the Covid pandemic, they refused to wear masks because they said no one should be able to tell them what to do with their bodies, but now with abortion they are regulating women's bodies.  
Person A: Definitely
Person B: Republicans do not care much about policy compared to Democrats and will change positions depending on what the head of their party thinks.  
Person B: Another example is when Obama was in office, favorability towards drone strikes were very low for both Democrats and Republicans.  The moment Trump came into office, Republicans favored using drone strikes while Democrats continued to not like them
Person A: They are definitely two sided in their decisions. They want to be independent and individuals but support laws that take away rights from other people
Person B: So they literally just were anti-war because of a Democrat and were fine with it when a Republican did it. 
Person B: Yes, I agree. 
Person B: They are also very frustrating with their pro-life stance.  They are so adamant against abortion but refuse to do anything about school shootings.  They care more about CRT and that we shouldn't teach kids about slavery rather than keep them safe from guns. 
Person B: It's very two-sided. 
Person A: I think they need to be kept out of power or our country will start going downhill with personal rights.
