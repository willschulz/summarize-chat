Person A: I think that Republicans are more hypocritical. Many Republicans are big fans of God/Christianity/religion but are more concerned with benefitting themselves rather than taking care of others as God intended.
Person B: I think Republicans are more hypocritical. There was just a mass shooting in Texas that killed lots of young children and adults. They do not want to progress common-sense gun laws that would help reduce these atrocities going forward. Yet, the supreme court just had documents leaked that contained information that they may be willing to overturn Roe vs Wade, which is a huge victory for Republicans. They immediately took action to order more security for the Supreme Court justices
Person B: That's an excellent point, the Republican party is the party of Christianity. They flaunt it, but then do things like support someone who wants to dismantle democracy. How can you both follow the word of God and support a habitual liar?
Person A: I absolutely agree with Maestro. Republicans are so concerned about "saving lives" by banning abortions, yet 19 ACTUAL lives were lost in the school shooting in Texas this week and the immediate Republican reaction is "don't take my guns." It's sickening.
Person A: I really would like to hear a Republican point of view here, just to see what the argument would be, because I really can't fathom how they can defend their position right now.
Person B: Absolutely. They've been working to take away a woman's right to abortion. They work tirelessly at that cause to "save lives", yet blame everyone except the gun manufacturers when we lead the world by a large margin in mass shootings. They gladly accept NRA donations, and feign that they care when tragic shootings occur, but take not action.
Person A: I also think it's extremely hypocritical to say that abortions should be banned "to save lives" yet be opposed to funding social welfare programs to help support people once they are born.
Person B: It's indefensible, in my opinion, but logic seems to not be a huge priority. God and fear-mongering are their weapons. The internet and the ease of spreading misinformation has inflamed the issue and stirred up more support for their causes.
Person A: I was raised as a Christian and though I do still believe in a higher power, I can't identify with a religion that seems to encourage its believers/members to think and behave this way.
Person B: And they use the First and Second Amendment as shields in most situation. I'm a liberal gun owner, and I absolutely support making gun ownership more difficult to attain than a needed abortion or even buying a car. I can drive to yard sale and buy a gun right now.
